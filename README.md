# Shell Setup
Dotfiles and configs for husky@mattlab.

Forked from and inspired by Taggart's [shell setup repo](https://github.com/mttaggart/shell-setup) â™¥

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HuskyHacks/shell-setup
cd shell-setup
./setup.sh
```

This sets up fish as the default prompt, but my bashrc file is in there too if you want to use bash instead.
