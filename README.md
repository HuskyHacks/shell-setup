# Shell Setup
Dotfiles and configs for husky@mattlab.

Forked from and inspired by Taggart's [shell setup repo](https://github.com/mttaggart/shell-setup) â™¥

## Quickstart

### One Liner Quickstart
Cuz who doesn't like curling right to the shell?

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HuskyHacks/shell-setup/main/quickstart.sh | sh
```

### Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HuskyHacks/shell-setup
cd shell-setup
./setup.sh
```

This sets up fish as the default prompt, but my bashrc file is in there too if you want to use bash instead.
